1.4 RegionsOrStates: Administrative boundaries (e.g., states, provinces) or operational regions where the ADS is certified to function.
1.5 InterferenceZones: Zones with potential signal or sensor interference, such as dense urban areas, tunnels, or locations with heavy foliage.

2. Drivable Area
2.1 DrivableAreaType:
2.1.1 Motorways: High-capacity roads limited to motorized vehicles with higher speed limits.
2.1.2 RadialRoads: Major roads (A-roads) that connect motorways to urban centers or distributor roads.

2.2.2.1 Divided: Indicates if the road has a physical separation, such as a median, between lanes going in opposite directions.
2.2.2.2 Undivided: Refers to a road where traffic in both directions shares the same surface, without any physical separation.
2.2.2.3 Pavements: Describes the presence or absence of pedestrian walkways or sidewalks along the road.
2.2.2.4 BarriersOnEdges: Highlights whether the road edges have safety barriers or guardrails to prevent vehicles from leaving the roadway.
2.2.3 LongitudinalPlane: The vertical road profile, including slopes and level sections.

2.4 DrivableAreaSigns: Focus on detecting only road signs close to the cameras or car in this location, ensuring they are relevant to the vehicle's immediate driving environment. Only detect signs that are clearly visible in the image. If no sign is visible, return an empty list. Do not infer the presence of a sign unless it is explicitly visible. If uncertain, do not include it. Signs should match standard road sign designs. Avoid detecting shapes, texts, or objects that resemble signs but are not actual road signs.
2.4.1 RegulatorySigns: Mandatory rules such as stop signs or speed limits, if they exist in the images.
